# About Refuel Robotics

## Our Vision

We're building the software infrastructure that powers autonomous vehicle refueling. Our hardware integration and motion control systems enable robotic arms to safely and efficiently refuel vehicles at gas stations, EV charge points, and fleet depots.

## The Problem

Traditional refueling requires human operators, limiting availability and increasing costs. Fleet operators need 24/7 autonomous refueling capabilities to maximize vehicle utilization and reduce operational overhead.

## Our Solution

**Software-first approach to autonomous refueling:**

- **Motion Control**: Advanced simulation and control algorithms for precise robotic arm movement
- **Hardware Integration**: Modular software that works with existing robotic arm systems
- **Fleet Management**: Scalable software architecture for multi-location deployment

## Leadership

**Manoj Namburi** brings 10+ years of embedded systems and automation QA experience from Dell, AMD, and WindRiver. This background in hardware-software integration and quality assurance is critical for building reliable autonomous systems.

## Market Opportunity

- **Fleet Operations**: Autonomous refueling for commercial vehicle fleets
- **Gas Stations**: 24/7 unmanned refueling capabilities
- **EV Charging**: Automated charging for electric vehicles
- **Fleet Depots**: Integrated refueling systems for large vehicle operations

## Technology Stack

- **Website Development**: Modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript with responsive design
- **Video Platform**: Optimized MP4 encoding with embedded player
- **Hardware Integration**: LeRobot SO-101 robotic arm compatibility
- **Software Architecture**: Modular, scalable systems for autonomous operations

## Company Status

- **Location**: Toronto, Canada
- **Stage**: Pre-seed, seeking funding and partnerships
- **Focus**: Software development and hardware integration
