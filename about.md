# About Refuel Robotics

## Our Vision

We're building the software infrastructure that powers autonomous vehicle refueling. Our computer vision and motion control systems enable robotic arms to safely and efficiently refuel vehicles at gas stations, EV charge points, and fleet depots.

## The Problem

Traditional refueling requires human operators, limiting availability and increasing costs. Fleet operators need 24/7 autonomous refueling capabilities to maximize vehicle utilization and reduce operational overhead.

## Our Solution

**Software-first approach to autonomous refueling:**

- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8-based detection systems identify fuel ports across different vehicle types
- **Motion Control**: Advanced ROS simulation and control algorithms for precise robotic arm movement
- **Hardware Integration**: Modular software that works with existing robotic arm systems
- **Fleet Management**: Scalable software architecture for multi-location deployment

## Founder

**Manoj Namburi** brings 10+ years of embedded systems and automation QA experience from Dell, AMD, and WindRiver. This background in hardware-software integration and quality assurance is critical for building reliable autonomous systems.

## Market Opportunity

- **Fleet Operations**: Autonomous refueling for commercial vehicle fleets
- **Gas Stations**: 24/7 unmanned refueling capabilities
- **EV Charging**: Automated charging for electric vehicles
- **Fleet Depots**: Integrated refueling systems for large vehicle operations

## Technology Stack

- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8 object detection for fuel port identification
- **Motion Planning**: ROS-based simulation and control systems
- **Hardware Integration**: LeRobot SO-101 robotic arm compatibility
- **Software Architecture**: Modular, cloud-connected systems for fleet management

## Company Status

- **Location**: Toronto, Canada (relocating to San Francisco)
- **Stage**: Pre-seed, seeking funding and partnerships
- **Focus**: Software development and hardware integration
