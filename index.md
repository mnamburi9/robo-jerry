# Refuel Robotics

**Software-first company building computer vision and motion control systems that power robotic arms for autonomous vehicle refueling.**

## Our Mission

We're developing advanced robotic systems for autonomous refueling at gas stations, EV charge points, and fleet depots. Our computer vision and motion control software enables robotic arms to safely and efficiently refuel vehicles without human intervention.

## Founder

**Manoj Namburi** - 10+ years in embedded systems and automation QA at Dell, AMD, and WindRiver. Based in Toronto with plans to move to San Francisco.

## Technology Stack

- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8-based detection for fuel port identification
- **Motion Control**: Advanced ROS simulation and control systems
- **Hardware Integration**: LeRobot SO-101 robotic arm testing
- **Software Architecture**: Modular, scalable systems for fleet deployment
